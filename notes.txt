The process of establishing the services that a customer
requires from a system and the constraints under which
it operates and is developed.
The system requirements are the descriptions of the
system services and constraints that are generated
during the requirements engineering process.
Chapter 4 Requirements Engineering 7
What is a requirement?
It may range from a high-level abstract statement of a
service or of a system constraint to a detailed
mathematical functional specification.
This is inevitable as requirements may serve a dual
function
May be the basis for a bid for a contract - therefore must be open
to interpretation;
May be the basis for the contract itself - therefore must be
defined in detail;
Both these statements may be called requirements
