Ever feel like you don’t have enough time to read everything that you want to? What if you could run a routine that summarized documents for you, whether it’s your favorite news source, academic articles, or work-related documents?Text summarization is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that summarizes the information in large texts for quicker consumption without losing vital information.
