The Life of Olaudah Equiano

Olaudah Equiano lived a life filled with hardships. He had everything taken from him including his family, from a young age. Equiano was a slave since he was a child that emerged from the African Holocaust, and later became an englishman. He wrote his autobiography, “The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano”, and it became one of the best selling books during this time period. The book details his experiences throughout his life as a slave.

Equiano was born in 1745 in Africa, and lived a good childhood in a good, spiritual society. When Equiano was eleven, he was kidnapped by African slavers, along with his sister. “... they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a small house, where the robbers halted for refreshment, and spent the night.”(Equiano, Pg 106). This quote talks about the conditions for the slaves as they travel towards the slave ships, and tells how dire the situation was for him, his sister, and the other slaves that were captured.  Later on, his sister, his only source of anything positive, ended up separating from him. He described the slave ship as very crowded, and suffocating. It was filled with a lot of death and sickness and contiunally filled with groaning from the dying men and women on the ship, which shows ghat the slave ship’s conditions were horrible. Equiano was purchased by a Royal Navy officer, Michael Henry Pascal, and Pascal ended up renaming Equiano to Gustavus Vassa. Equiano and Pascal traveled to England a year later after Equiano got captured, and he describes the experience as less terrifying, comparing to his experiences in the slave market and the middle passage. During his stay in London, Pascal’s cousins taught Equiano arithmetic and literature, and Equiano was happy that Pascal’s family gave him the opportunity to learn. During his time in England, he learned that being there has a lot of opportunities for him to grow. The moment of peace for Equiano didn’t last long, as England entered a war in 1758 where Pascal and Equiano both took a part in for seven years. After the war, Equiano assumed he was going to gain his freedom, but ended up being sold to another master, as Pascal never granted his freedom. Equiano went back to the West Indies, where he landed 7 years ago and continued to grow, as a person, and as an englishman. During his time as a slave under Robert King, he was able to become a very successful merchant, and was able to impress Robert King enough to grant him his freedom. Equiano was filled with joy and delirium after he was set free. After being set free, he was recaptured for some time but eventually was able to escape from it. He was able to publish his book, “The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano”, and worked towards the abolishment of slavery.

Equiano had a rough life, and him surviving through slavery and everything that happened to him after it is very incredible, and shows that he was a strong man mentally. Even when he lost the only family he had when he was kidnapped from home, his sister, he was able to persevere through it and continue to fight. When it comes to slavery, weakness would get you killed really fast. He faced many hardships going through the middle passage, and while he was in the slave market. If I was in his shoes, I don’t believe I would be able to survive through the roughness and the hardships of slavery, and what it does to you mentally even if you do survive. I wouldn’t be able to live life without being in constant fear of being kidnapped, or killed just because of my skin color.  I really admire Equiano’s mentality, especially after he landed in England.  He saw opportunities for growth very fast after learning arithmetic and literature, and immediately grew as a person when he became a merchant. He was able to continuously grow into a successful person, and was able to “beat the odds”, and become a successful englishman. On top of that, he also became a best selling author, which was a very big deal back in the 19th century. After being freed, he began fighting against slavery, even though it would become very risky for him. He fought using his writing and using all the knowledge he gained throughout the years of his life. I believe that Equiano’s life was really just like a rollercoaster, it had very high ups, and very low downs, and even at the lowest points of his life, he never gave up.
